# Validation with a given model

This submodule performs inference in a set of images and returns a JSON with several performance metrics obtained. To ensure the proper usage of this script, we need images in a PNG/JPG format and their corresponding bounding boxes in the CADICA format. You must set this folder structure within this folder in order to successfully make inferences.
